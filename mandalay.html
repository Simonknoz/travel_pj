        <h3>The Shwenandaw Monastery</h3>
        <p>
          The Shwenandaw known as Golden Palace Monastery has its unique and
          magnificent beauty, formed by teak carvings depicting tales from
          Buddhist mythology in all of its roof and walls. The monastery was
          formerly a royal apartment built by King Mindon. After his death in
          1878, King Thibaw (the son of King Mindon) moved the palace to the
          current location as he thought that the ghost of his father still
          existed in there. In the year 1883, it transformed into a monastery
          until now.

        <h3>The KuThoDaw Pagoda</h3>
        <p>
          Places we mentioned above were mostly built with woods because of a
          bountiful supply of wood that time. Unlike other forms of the
          monastery, Maha Aung Mye Bon Zan Monastery was built of brick and
          stucco. The usual name of this monastery is Mal Nu Oak Monastery – in
          that, “Mal Nu” was the Queen who built this monastery and “Oak” means
          brick. It is remarked as the impressive architecture of Konbaung
          dynasty. It is a well-preserved and long-standing building though it
          endures the effect of climate and human activities since 1818.

        <p>
          It is nearby from Kuthodaw Pagoda located at the foot of Mandalay
          Hill. Sanda Muni Pagoda is famous for the large iron Buddha image
          called Sanda Muni Buddha image and its hundreds of shrines containing
          inscribed marble slabs. It was built as a memorial to the death of
          Prince Kanaung who was murdered in 1866 along with three princes. The
          graves of the princes were buried on the Sanda Muni Pagoda terrace.
          Lately, the graves were moved to a Mandalay mausoleum.

        <p>
          Mahamuni Buddha Temple is one of the major pilgr/assets/images located
          in the southwest of Mandalay. Inside the temple, there is a big Buddha
          statue called Mahamuni Buddha Image. Some say that its origin is from
          Arakan brought as the but as the legendary stated that the image is
          one of the likenesses of Buddha, made at the time of Budda alive; two
          /assets/images were in paradise, and two were in India.

        <h3>Mandalay hill</h3>
        <p>
          After 45 minutes walking through covered stairs from the foot, one
          will reach the summit of Mandalay, which is 120 meters above sea
          level. The city took its name and has been a major pilgrimage site for
          Burmese Buddhists for nearly two centuries. Travelers can get there by
          taking a car ride or by foot.Once you reach the top of the mountain,
          you feel the attractive panoramic view of Mandalay City. You will see
          a little bit crowded people taking photographs. Watching sunset or
          sunrise over the hill is worth for a visit. Especially for the sunset,
          the atmosphere around the pagoda is calm and peaceful.

        <h3>U Bein Bridge</h3>
        <p>
          U Bein Bridge is a should-not-miss place from Amarapura. It is almost
          40 minutes drive from Mandalay, which spans over Taungthaman Lake. The
          bridge becomes the highlight of Mandalay tour to enjoy amazing sunset
          and sunrise for the travelers as well as to take awesome photographs.
          It was recognized as the longest teak bridge in the world using 1,086
          pillars. But some small part of maintenance is made upon the needs so
          that you will see some of the parts are replaced with new
          wood.Watching the sunset will offer a feeling of missing somebody and
          viewing the sunrise will release the tension of your life. Be aware of
          crowded with tourists and local merchants, but complaining as a
          touristy destination is not true. So, we recommend the travelers to
          take a boat to feel the full experience of a picturesque wooden
          structure while watching sunset or sunrise.

        <h3>Mandalay Palace</h3>
        <p>
          It is the last royal palace of the last kingdom of Myanmar, Konbaung
          Dynasty. King Thibaw is the last king of Myanmar kingdom before
          captured by British Colony. Many places of the complex were destroyed
          during the World War II by the bomb attack, but only the royal mint
          and the watch tower survived. Then it was rebuilt at the start of the
          1990s with some modern materials.
